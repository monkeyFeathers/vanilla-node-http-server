# Vanilla node http server

Simple server that:
- accepts a get request to '/time' and will respond with the current time.
- accepts a get request to '/greet/name' and will respond with 'Hello, name'
- accepts a post request to '/greet' and will respond with 'Hello, name' if a 'name' param is sent as part of the post request.
